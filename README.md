A work in progress, put on pause for now, as Baudio is not performant using evented variable modifiers, as it might be if someone ported it to use streams2...

Aiming to be a type of instrument using the xbox controller.

The catch?  Instead of simply playing notes directly, I'm taking a melody-generating approach, inspired by a combination of substack's work with baudio and the serendipitous music seemingly randomly birthed from 3D printers.

My theory is that some of the best melodies from both examples come from enough very close, but changing frequencies sliding past each other.

For example, a 3D printer creates melodies when printing curves and circles, which tells me that the two frequencies of the stepper motors combine to create interesting resonant melodies.

Substack's baudio examples prove that CG sine waves, layered enough, can generate melodies as well.

My goal is to give a user control of this kind of frequency generation, to allow a tighter feedback loop for a music generating piece of software.

A single thumbstick should be capable of making all the harmonies that a 3D printer is capable of, being a 2-axis velocity-based input.  An xbox 360 controller has 2 such thumbsticks, and two half-resolution triggers, which could be used for volume control, not to mention all the buttons, for changing instrument?  tonal range?  I'm really looking forward to getting this thing, I probably should've just bought a wired controller from my local video game shack.
